// Btw I figured out my MOVZX problem from earlier, but it's funny so I'm leaving it
// I even figured it out without StackOverflow pls tell me you're proud of me
// The reason why char -> int sometimes extends to 0 and sometimes to F is this:
// char is signed by default, so if the first bit (sign bit) is on, it will extend that
// to the first bit on the int (MOVSX instruction)
// just use unsigned char to avoid it

// ngl was even tempted to use inline assembly this is what happens to your brain when
// you work offline

// for real tho, why tf is char signed by default
// its probably machine dependent (since there is the explicit signed qualifier for char)

// This file is probably the biggest bogus I've ever published anyway
