# Dragontype
Dragontype is a small C library providing the types that [dragonblocks_alpha](https://github.com/dragonblocks/dragonblocks_alpha) uses.
It serves a similar purpose as the C++ standard library would, but C++ is just bloated af.
This library is only capable of what dragonblocks needs, and it does not intend to be general purpose.

Included are Array, Bintree, List and Queue as well as numeric types.
